What is J-STAR ?

A Desktop version PI-STAR, with HDMI, Remote Desktop, High efficiency software toolkit for MMDVM Project. In this project (build in Raspbian OS), you can easy to make the following interesting functions work.
`MMDVM Digital mode, FM Mode, FM Netowrk,  Alistarlink, DVSwitch, Sip, Analog_reflector, USRP Client, APRS(Direwolf) ,and so on`

Also I add some very useful tools, such as: visual software manager, Pi-Apps, you can install the application you need, such as AnyDesk, just like you use Windows, MacOS convenient.
